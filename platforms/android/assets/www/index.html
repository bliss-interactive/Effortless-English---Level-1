  Hi. How are you doing today? I'm writing because you asked for my 7-<br>
  Day email course and you want to improve your English. You will get 8<br>
  emails from me-- one every day for 8 days.<br>
  <br>
  This Email Course is sent only to subscribers.<br>

  <br>
  My name is A.J. Hoge. I live in San Francisco, USA. I am an English<br>
  teacher. I have a Masters degree in Teaching English. I enjoy travel,<br>
  SCUBA diving, motorcycle riding, movies, and learning Spanish.<br>
  <br>
  I will teach you a new method for learning. I will teach<br>
  you how to study-- to speak English faster and more easily.<br>
<br>
  <strong>***Your First Suggestion</strong><br>
  <br>
  Imagine speaking English automatically... without thinking. The words<br>
  come out of your mouth easily, and fast. You understand instantly.<br>
  <br>
  To do this, you must change the way you study English. Your first action<br>
  is to stop studying English words. What?<br>
  <br>
  Stop studying English words.<br>
  <br>
  That's right, do not memorize words. Native speakers do not learn<br>
  English by remembering single words. Native speakers learn phrases.<br>
  Phrases are GROUPS of words that naturally go together.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>**Learn 4x Faster</strong><br>
  <br>
  Research by Dr. James Asher proves that learning with phrases is 4-5<br>
  times faster than studying individual words. 4-5 Times Faster.<br>
  <br>
  Also, students who learn phrases have much better grammar.<br>
  <br>
  ***RULE 1: Always Study and Review Phrases, Not Individual Words<br>
  <br>
  Never study a single, individual word. Never.<br>
  <br>
  When you find a new word, always write down The Phrase it is in. Always.<br>
  When you review, always review all of the phrase,.. not the word.<br>
  <br>
  Collect phrases. Your speaking and grammar will improve 4-5 times<br>
  faster. Never again study a single word. Never write a single word in<br>
  your notebook, always write the complete phrase.<br>
  <br>
  Learn Phrases Only.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>**Your Next Tip Comes Tomorrow</strong><br>
  <br>
  During this week, I will teach you 7 rules for learning English. I will send<br>
  you a new rule each day, for 7 days.<br>
  <br>
  I look forward to helping you improve your English!<br>
  <br>
  Have a great day :)<br>

                    </div>
                    <div id="rule2"><p>Hi. How are you? Are you having a good day? I'm doing fine. Let's get<br>
  started with Day 2 of your email course.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>**Rule 2: A Story From Angelina</strong><br>
  <br>
  &quot;My name is Angelina and I'm a student from Paraguay. When I started<br>
  learning with A.J., I couldn't speak any English. I had studied English grammar many years, but I couldn't speak.<br>
  <br>
  The first day with A.J.'s Effortless English I thought I would study<br>
  grammar. However, he surprised me because he never taught grammar<br>
  rules.<br>
  <br>
  Instead, he told a story. He told it many times, in a strange way. He<br>
  constantly asked questions, and I answered the questions. The questions<br>
  were super-easy.<br>
  <br>
  Honestly, I was a little confused. I thought he was kind of a crazy teacher<br>
  :) I thought I needed to learn more grammar.<br>
  <br>
  I continued with Effortless English and then, after only two weeks,<br>
  something amazing happened. My speaking improved! My friends asked<br>
  me, 'How are you improving so quickly?'<br>
  <br>
  I realized that A.J. was quite clever, and the stories and questions and<br>
  articles were teaching me to speak English, without studying grammar<br>
  rules. Wow!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Angelina is a great student. She learned extra fast because she listened<br>
  to Effortless English 5 hours a day. However, you can improve with just<br>
  one hour a day.<br>
  <br>
  You can get the same results... but you must follow Rule 2.</p>
<p><strong>**RULE 2: Don't Study Grammar</strong><br>
  <br>
  Angelina quickly improved speaking-- when she stopped studying<br>
  grammar. This is your second rule.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Stop studying grammar.</em><br>
  <em>Stop studying grammar.</em><br>
  <br>
  Right now. Stop. Put away your grammar books and textbooks.<br>
  Grammar rules teach you to think about English, you want to speak<br>
  automatically-- without thinking!<br>
  <br>
  With Effortless English, you learn English without grammar study. Your<br>
  speaking improves quickly. You succeed. You speak English naturally.<br>
  <br>
  So Rule 2 is: Don't Study Grammar!<br>
  <br>
  <strong>*The Vital Secret For English Learning Power</strong><br>
  <br>
  In the next email, I will discuss the most important rule for speaking<br>
  English easily.<br>
  <br>
  Have a great day and continue to improve your English :)<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Take Care,<br>

                    <div id="rule3">Hi! This is A.J. again, with the next day of your 7 Rules Email Course. I<br>
really enjoy emailing you and helping you improve English.<br>
<br>
Today is the most important rule.<br>
<br>
Most schools ignore it.<br>
<br>
<strong>**Rule 3: A Story</strong><br>
<br>
Humberto is from Venezuela. He moved to Canada a few years ago. He<br>
studied English in Venezuela for many years-- mostly grammar.<br>
<br>
In fact, Humberto learned English with his eyes- by reading textbooks, by<br>
studying grammar books, by remembering word lists.<br>
<br>
He thought his English was good. But when he came to Canada he was<br>
surprised and shocked-- he couldn't understand anyone!<br>
He joined an English school in Canada. He went to school everyday.<br>
What did they teach him? More textbooks, more grammar books, more<br>
word lists!<br>
<br>
After 12 months of school, Humberto was angry and frustrated. The<br>
school cost over $10,000 for one year-- but he still could not speak<br>
English. He didn't know what to do.<br>
<br>
<strong>He said:</strong><br>
<br>
&quot;I couldn't believe it A.J. After one year, I still couldn't speak English. I<br>
told the teacher, 'this is a waste of time'. I was very upset.<br>
Thank God I found a better way. Now I can speak English. I understand<br>
native speakers. I talk to Canadians every day. I feel confident. I can't<br>
believe I wasted so much time with schools... and so much money too!&quot;<br>
<br>
<strong>**RULE 3: The Most Important Rule-- Listen First</strong><br>
<br>
What is the rule that Humberto found? Simple. The rule is listening.<br>
<br>
<strong> Listening, listening, listening.</strong><br>
<br>
You must listen to UNDERSTANDABLE English. You must listen to<br>
English EVERYDAY. Don't read textbooks. Listen to English.<br>
<br>
Its simple. That is the key to your English success. Stop reading<br>
textbooks. Start listening everyday.<br>
<br>
<strong>**Learn With Your Ears, Not Your Eyes</strong><br>
<br>
In most schools, you learn English with your eyes. You read textbooks.<br>
You study grammar rules.<br>
<br>
Effortless English is a listening system. You learn English with your ears,<br>
not your eyes. You listen 1-3 hours every day.<br>
<br>
Your speaking improves quickly. You speak English easily-- just like<br>
Humberto.<br>
<br>
Spend most of your study time listening- that is the key to great<br>
speaking.<br>
<br>
<strong>* The Next Powerful Method</strong><br>
<br>
Good luck. I know you can do it.<br>
<br>
Have a great day. Enjoy these emails and enjoy your English learning!<br>
<br>
<br>
Take Care,<br>

&quot;Hi AJ, Ever since I joined Effortless English Club, I have been listening to<br>
every lesson I downloaded into my MP3 player for 5-6 hours a day.<br>
Whenever my boss is not around, I put a headphone on and start listening<br>
to them!&quot;</div>
